## Task 1
Rewrite the task from the previous lesson using `get` and `set` methods.

## Task 2
Create an object `garden` with multiple properties, such as `orange`, `apple`, `pear`, etc.
Using the `for (key in object) {}` syntax, change the names of the keys, making them all uppercase.
Using the `for (key in object) {}` syntax, output the values of all keys.
Use the `for (key in object) {}` syntax and add a check for the existence of the key "apple". If such a key exists, output the value of the key "pear" to the console, assigning it a new value "delicious".

## Task 3
Create a string `classmates` and list the names of several students in it.
Split the string using the `split` method and store the result in a constant `classmatesArr`.
Then join the array using the `join` method and store the result in a constant `newClassmates`.

## Task 4
Create an array `currency` and put 6 different values into it.
Create a variable `newCurrency`.
Using the `splice` method, remove 3 elements from the array, starting from the second element, and insert 1 element with the value "I will earn big money by programming" in their place.
Put all of this into the variable `newCurrency`.
Output `currency` and `newCurrency` to the console and see if the original array mutated.
